**0. Warmup reading**
* [A brief digital forensics cycle by Linux and Disk Forensics](./refs/Acompleteforensicprocesspdf)


**1. Task**

Complete the challenge posted on Honeynet: [scan 24](http://www.honeynet.onofri.org/scans/scan24/)


**2. Report**

Write a report about the process you complete the tasks in the description, key screen snapshots are needed as evidences. It is suggested to organized the contents following the steps described in [A brief digital forensics cycle by Linux and Disk Forensics](./refs/Acompleteforensicprocesspdf):
* Identification: identify the infected system
* Image Acquisition: acquiring the disk image/partition of the infected system
* Data Recovery: try to recover all deleted or corrupted data from the disk image
* Analysis: analyse the disk image for collecting evidences
* Reporting: write a report about the evidences collected, tools used, techniques exploited, timeline of the evidences and reconstruct the crime scene if possible.

6. What Microsoft program was used to create the Cover Page file. What is your proof (Proof is the key to getting this question right, not just making a guess).
